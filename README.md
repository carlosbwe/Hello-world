# Hello-world
So this is the tutorial, yep. Incredible work here.

My name is Carlos Bermejo PÃ©rez and I am a professional translator and interpreter. My studies have always been related to Arts and languages, so I don't have a very scientific mind. I love technology, though, so I'm very excited about learning how to write some code using repositories.
